# Word Guessing Game

This is a simple word guessing game, or more popularly known as hangman. Opted not to use the hangman graphic as I feel it is an insensitive image.
Premise is the same, 6 wrong guesses and you lose the game.

## Getting Started

To run the program locally, clone the repo and:

```
npm install
```

or

```
yarn add
```

Either package manager you choose should work and install all the dependencies

### How To Use

```
npm start
```

or

```
yarn start
```

Go to localhost:3000 and you should see the game

Demo coming soon...
